# chrome-web-extension

v1.0 - "Save BOOKMARKS easy"
basic coding is now done. save input & save current chrome tab now creates entries. the delete button clears out the localStorage by doubleclick

THE IDEA AND TEMPLATE FOR THIS CODE !!

this project is part of the Front-End Developer Career Path from Scrimba. I do like the idea of a self-coded chrome web extension, so i decided to put this on github to see what i can do with it, along my way on the career path. Will add new features, as soon as i learn them.
